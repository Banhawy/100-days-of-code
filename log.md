# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 15th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Made a snowman using js.p5 
Created an organization account on github for my local FCC group for future group projects.

**Thoughts:** I usually prefer to solve code and mathematical challenges and always avoided spending time learning about css and js drawings. But now that I tried out p5.js I can see some potential fun using it to draw and make some drawings interactive.

Also my local FCC group which me and a friend I met on the local FB group revived into a regular meetup is going spectacularly well. We decided to build a website for the group so everyone can contribute and practice their skills, as well as get a taste of collaborative coding and version control. In today's meeting we set up our git repo and collaboration tools and planned ahead.

### Day 2: January 16th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
I was visited by family this week so I spent all day driving around and shopping in malls. I downloaded an educational app that teaches C++, and spent my time in stores revisiting the basics of C++ which I had not coded in for years. Did some arrays and string challenges on Hackerrank.com when I got home in C++, Javascript, and C#.

**Thoughts:** I considered working on projects but I was mentally and physically drained. I find that revisiting languages I am not very proficient in and doing easy to medium challenges refreshes and adds to my knowledge without much effort, and is a good way to end the day. 

I also plan to follow Hackerrank's 30 days of code challenges challenge.

### Day 3: January 17th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Completed the Data types challenge for C++ on Hackerrank. 
Started the Wikipedia project on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** I am learning more and more about the string class in C++ and how to display values accurately on screen.

### Day 4: January 18th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Solved an intermediate FCC challenge in Javascript in 15 minutes.

**Thoughts:** This is one of the long days at school. I am in college for about 13-14 hours for lectures. Thankfully, there are gaps in between in which I study and I decided to do an algorithm challenge on FCC because I knew I'd be too tired by the time I got home. Access to big whiteboard certainly hepled.

### Day 5: January 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Started a JavaScript project that will create a webapp that solves linear systems of equations.

**Thoughts:** This project involves some math and algebra. I am trying to implement the Row Reduction Echelon Form algorithm and embeded in the app. I found out that a white board helps a lot. 

Also, it might look like I skipped 2 days but I actually practiced C++ on my phone outside all day during those 2 days

### Day 6: January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Improved and fixed a bug in the Reduced Row Echelon Form algorithm I am writing for the linear systems solving webapp.
Had the weekly meeting with fellow coders and aspiring webdevelopers and setup our development environment on each individual machine as well as did some group planning for phases of our group project.

**Thoughts:** Even though I was very sick and had a cold, I powered through the day and got some work done.

## Day 7: July 14, 2017

**6 Months Progress**:
I can't remember a single day in the past 6 months where I hadn't looked at code or wrote some. Granted I did not work on as many personal projects as I wanted but that's because I got a web developer job/internship and I started a computer science degree at the University of Minnesota. But I have learned a lot of useful concepts in software engineering and best practices and developer tools at work. Since it's summertime now and I have some free time on my hands now I will continue the 100 day challenge to log my progress.

Today I designed a new portfolio layout and started coding three pages (homepage/CV/Portfolio). I intend to make it mobile first and adhere to responive web design best practices.

## Day 8: July 15th

**Today's progress**:
After a lot of experimenting and optimizing my gulp and SASS worklows, I created and uploaded a gist of the gulpfile I use to compile SASS and reload browser on changes. 

**Thoughts:**
I kept working on my online resume. It's been a challenge hosting it on github pages but I've managed to implement responsive design best practices and laid out a solid foundation for my personal website.

## Day 9: July 16th

**Today's progress**:
Made good progress on my resume page of my website.

**Thoughts:**
Managed to get github pages up and running.

## Day 10: July 17th
**Today's Progress:**
Created a front/landing page for my website and animated it with jQuery.

**Thoughts:**
Got to use SASS mixins to create a resuable CSS card layout. I am starting to get better with SASS and I can feel its power now.

## Day 11: July 18th
**Today's Progress:**
I started reading ReactJS's documentation and played around with the library and JSX syntax. I can see the potential in the frame work. Also started writing a chrome extension which I intent to finish tomorrow.

**Thoughts:**
I'm starting to like React. I plan to do a version on my website in React at some point after making a React application I have in mind

## Day 12: July 19th
**Today's Progress:**
I finished my chrome extension and published it to the google web store after extensive testing. It's the first actual product I put on any store before.

**Thoughts:**
I played with chrome extensions in the past which is why I was able to skim through the documentation and write the code faster this time. I plan to spend the rest of the day reading about and experimenting with ReactJS.

## Day 13: July 20th
**Today's Progress:**
Finished builing my first React bulletin board application (after experimenting with a few simple pages to get the syntax right) and deployed it to github pages.

**Thoughts:**
I wrote a blog post on Medium on how to declare React components and trying to explain it on there helped me gain a better understanding of React and learn its syntax faster.

## Day 14: July 21
**Today's Progress:**
Made some changes to my chrome extension to use more modular functions. Added new laughing Obama feature which replaces pictures of trump with Obama. Published to the google web store!

**Thoughts:**
Honestly this project is so much fun! I am learning a lot about the structure of the DOM, its elements, and how to traverse them. Only issue with the new featture is I have to rely on human inputted src value that describes pictures of trump accurately. In the future it would be better to rely on a deep learning model to detet Trump's face instead. Good opportunity to learn deep learning!

# Day 15: July 22
**Today's Progress:**
Wrote and published a new chrome extension The Obamanator is a javascript extension that changes ALL images and icons into a random obama picture/gif. This was a quick fun project that I made at the request of a freind.

# Day 16: July 23
**Today's Progress:**
Used python class and data structure (list) to add projectsto my portfolio page which I animated and tested thorougly for responsive design. Also worked on old projects to fix and optomize code whenever possible. 

**Thoughts**:
I came accross an old Quote Generator project that I had used a json file to store quotes and authors info hosted on my personal dropbox, and I had set up an ajax GET call to it. For some reason dropbox stopped giving access for such calls and I used a github gist to story my json and fetch from there and that worked. That got me thinking about RESTful APIs and now I am experimenting with node.js mongoDB and Express so that I can build an API to serve quotes.

# Day 17: July 24
**Today's Progress:**
I had a long day and was exhausted by the time I got home late at night. I managed to battle the urge of just laying in bed and knocking out, and got to experiment a with React on codepen

**Thoughts:**
I've decided to do the wikipedia viwer app from Free Code Camp in React which is why I am laboring over react examples and documentations so much these days. Its reusable components just seem to be the perfect candidate for the job.

# Day 18: July 25
**Today's Progress:**
I have spent ALL night last night into the morning trying to figure out how to call APIs asynchrously and ran into a brick wall because of a CORS issue while developing localy. Today after much readings and research I managed to find a proxy server service that allowed me to call an API that didn't allow CORS. I experimented first with github API in react on codepen and started my wikipedia viewer.

# Day 19: July 27
**Today's Progress:**
I labored over the wikipedia viewer project I am coding in React. I've had to research a lot of React documentation and get help from the FCC and stackoverflow community which lead me to make successful API calls and optimize my app components. I've come a long way and React is slowly becoming intuative to me.

# Day 20: July 28
**Today's Progress:**
I started a free JSX course on Udemy and immediatly used what I learned to solve 3 intermediate algorithm challenges on freeCodeCamp.

# Day 21: July29:
**Today's Progress:**
I worked all day on my wikipedia viewer project trying to link the form and the listing views together in React. I finally managed to that without any errors and the project's required functionalities are done. Need to make it look pretty.

# Day 22: July31:
**Today's Progress:**
Spent the last two days learning hw to import and use external react libraries and managed to finally put the finishing touches on the Wikipedia Viewer project and deployed it to github after cross-browser testing.

**Thoughts:**
I am so excited! This is officially the first independant react project I built without any help or following video tutorials, besides those on react acrchitecture in general. It took me a week of constant struggle with so many trial and error and reading documentations. But it was worth it and I cam out of having a really good grasp of at least the basics of react and JSX. I plan to do FCC Twitchtv api next in react and maybe look into redux.
