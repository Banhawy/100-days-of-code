# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 15th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Made a snowman using js.p5 
Created an organization account on github for my local FCC group for future group projects.

**Thoughts:** I usually prefer to solve code and mathematical challenges and always avoided spending time learning about css and js drawings. But now that I tried out p5.js I can see some potential fun using it to draw and make some drawings interactive.

Also my local FCC group which me and a friend I met on the local FB group revived into a regular meetup is going spectacularly well. We decided to build a website for the group so everyone can contribute and practice their skills, as well as get a taste of collaborative coding and version control. In today's meeting we set up our git repo and collaboration tools and planned ahead.

### Day 2: January 16th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
I was visited by family this week so I spent all day driving around and shopping in malls. I downloaded an educational app that teaches C++, and spent my time in stores revisiting the basics of C++ which I had not coded in for years. Did some arrays and string challenges on Hackerrank.com when I got home in C++, Javascript, and C#.

**Thoughts:** I considered working on projects but I was mentally and physically drained. I find that revisiting languages I am not very proficient in and doing easy to medium challenges refreshes and adds to my knowledge without much effort, and is a good way to end the day. 

I also plan to follow Hackerrank's 30 days of code challenges challenge.
