# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 15th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Made a snowman using js.p5 
Created an organization account on github for my local FCC group for future group projects.

**Thoughts:** I usually prefer to solve code and mathematical challenges and always avoided spending time learning about css and js drawings. But now that I tried out p5.js I can see some potential fun using it to draw and make some drawings interactive.

Also my local FCC group which me and a friend I met on the local FB group revived into a regular meetup is going spectacularly well. We decided to build a website for the group so everyone can contribute and practice their skills, as well as get a taste of collaborative coding and version control. In today's meeting we set up our git repo and collaboration tools and planned ahead.

### Day 2: January 16th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
I was visited by family this week so I spent all day driving around and shopping in malls. I downloaded an educational app that teaches C++, and spent my time in stores revisiting the basics of C++ which I had not coded in for years. Did some arrays and string challenges on Hackerrank.com when I got home in C++, Javascript, and C#.

**Thoughts:** I considered working on projects but I was mentally and physically drained. I find that revisiting languages I am not very proficient in and doing easy to medium challenges refreshes and adds to my knowledge without much effort, and is a good way to end the day. 

I also plan to follow Hackerrank's 30 days of code challenges challenge.

### Day 3: January 17th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Completed the Data types challenge for C++ on Hackerrank. 
Started the Wikipedia project on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** I am learning more and more about the string class in C++ and how to display values accurately on screen.

### Day 4: January 18th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Solved an intermediate FCC challenge in Javascript in 15 minutes.

**Thoughts:** This is one of the long days at school. I am in college for about 13-14 hours for lectures. Thankfully, there are gaps in between in which I study and I decided to do an algorithm challenge on FCC because I knew I'd be too tired by the time I got home. Access to big whiteboard certainly hepled.
