# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 15th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Made a snowman using js.p5 
Created an organization account on github for my local FCC group for future group projects.

**Thoughts:** I usually prefer to solve code and mathematical challenges and always avoided spending time learning about css and js drawings. But now that I tried out p5.js I can see some potential fun using it to draw and make some drawings interactive.

Also my local FCC group which me and a friend I met on the local FB group revived into a regular meetup is going spectacularly well. We decided to build a website for the group so everyone can contribute and practice their skills, as well as get a taste of collaborative coding and version control. In today's meeting we set up our git repo and collaboration tools and planned ahead.

### Day 2: January 16th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
I was visited by family this week so I spent all day driving around and shopping in malls. I downloaded an educational app that teaches C++, and spent my time in stores revisiting the basics of C++ which I had not coded in for years. Did some arrays and string challenges on Hackerrank.com when I got home in C++, Javascript, and C#.

**Thoughts:** I considered working on projects but I was mentally and physically drained. I find that revisiting languages I am not very proficient in and doing easy to medium challenges refreshes and adds to my knowledge without much effort, and is a good way to end the day. 

I also plan to follow Hackerrank's 30 days of code challenges challenge.

### Day 3: January 17th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Completed the Data types challenge for C++ on Hackerrank. 
Started the Wikipedia project on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** I am learning more and more about the string class in C++ and how to display values accurately on screen.

### Day 4: January 18th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Solved an intermediate FCC challenge in Javascript in 15 minutes.

**Thoughts:** This is one of the long days at school. I am in college for about 13-14 hours for lectures. Thankfully, there are gaps in between in which I study and I decided to do an algorithm challenge on FCC because I knew I'd be too tired by the time I got home. Access to big whiteboard certainly hepled.

### Day 5: January 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Started a JavaScript project that will create a webapp that solves linear systems of equations.

**Thoughts:** This project involves some math and algebra. I am trying to implement the Row Reduction Echelon Form algorithm and embeded in the app. I found out that a white board helps a lot. 

Also, it might look like I skipped 2 days but I actually practiced C++ on my phone outside all day during those 2 days

### Day 6: January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Improved and fixed a bug in the Reduced Row Echelon Form algorithm I am writing for the linear systems solving webapp.
Had the weekly meeting with fellow coders and aspiring webdevelopers and setup our development environment on each individual machine as well as did some group planning for phases of our group project.

**Thoughts:** Even though I was very sick and had a cold, I powered through the day and got some work done.

## Day 7: July 14, 2017

**6 Months Progress**:
I can't remember a single day in the past 6 months where I hadn't looked at code or wrote some. Granted I did not work on as many personal projects as I wanted but that's because I got a web developer job/internship and I started a computer science degree at the University of Minnesota. But I have learned a lot of useful concepts in software engineering and best practices and developer tools at work. Since it's summertime now and I have some free time on my hands now I will continue the 100 day challenge to log my progress.

Today I designed a new portfolio layout and started coding three pages (homepage/CV/Portfolio). I intend to make it mobile first and adhere to responive web design best practices.

## Day 8: July 15th

**Today's progress**:
After a lot of experimenting and optimizing my gulp and SASS worklows, I created and uploaded a gist of the gulpfile I use to compile SASS and reload browser on changes. 

**Thoughts:**
I kept working on my online resume. It's been a challenge hosting it on github pages but I've managed to implement responsive design best practices and laid out a solid foundation for my personal website.

## Day 9: July 16th

**Today's progress**:
Made good progress on my resume page of my website.

**Thoughts:**
Managed to get github pages up and running.

## Day 10: July 17th
**Today's Progress:**
Created a front/landing page for my website and animated it with jQuery.

**Thoughts:**
Got to use SASS mixins to create a resuable CSS card layout. I am starting to get better with SASS and I can feel its power now.

## Day 11: July 18th
**Today's Progress:**
I started reading ReactJS's documentation and played around with the library and JSX syntax. I can see the potential in the frame work. Also started writing a chrome extension which I intent to finish tomorrow.

**Thoughts:**
I'm starting to like React. I plan to do a version on my website in React at some point after making a React application I have in mind

## Day 12: July 19th
**Today's Progress:**
I finished my chrome extension and published it to the google web store after extensive testing. It's the first actual product I put on any store before.

**Thoughts:**
I played with chrome extensions in the past which is why I was able to skim through the documentation and write the code faster this time. I plan to spend the rest of the day reading about and experimenting with ReactJS.

## Day 12: July 19th
**Today's Progress:**
Finished builing my first React bulletin board application (after experimenting with a few simple pages to get the syntax right) and deployed it to github pages.

**Thoughts:**
I wrote a blog post on Medium on how to declare React components and trying to explain it on there helped me gain a better understanding of React and learn its syntax faster.
